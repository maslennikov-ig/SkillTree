- What retention mechanics are used (progress bars, gamification, micro-rewards)?
- Examples of wow-effects during test completion
- How to present results effectively and impressively?

### 2. AI Analysis & Personalization
- How do best EdTech solutions present AI recommendations?
- What visualizations are used for "strengths" and "growth zones"?
- How to make "student portraits" visually appealing?
- Creative ways to show career/university compatibility

### 3. Engagement & Conversion
- How do top EdTech projects motivate test completion and lesson sign-ups?
- What triggers engage parents?
- Email report best practices for parents (structure, visuals, CTAs)
- Mechanics for creating wow-moments when receiving results

### 4. Telegram-Specific Features
- Examples of top educational Telegram bots (global + Russian)
- Features used by successful Telegram Mini Apps
- Interactive elements that work well in Telegram
- How to make result sharing viral?

### 5. Gamification & Engagement
